## Overview

**AutoTidy** is a desktop utility designed for Windows and Linux users who want to automate the organization of frequently cluttered folders such as Downloads, Screenshots, or the Desktop. It helps maintain a clean digital workspace by systematically moving files based on user-defined rules.

This tool tackles the inefficiency of manual sorting and periodic cleanups, allowing users to set their organization preferences once and let AutoTidy handle the rest in the background.

---
## ‚ú® Core Functionality

*   **Folder Monitoring**: Users can select one or more local folders for AutoTidy to watch.
*   **Rule-Based Organization**: Define rules for each folder based on:
    *   **File Age**: Specify a minimum age (in days) for a file to be considered.
    *   **Filename Pattern**: Utilize **Enhanced Pattern Matching** with support for both wildcard (`fnmatch`) and Regular Expression (Regex) to identify files.
*   **Versatile File Actions**: Configure rules to automatically Move, Copy, Delete to Trash, or Permanently Delete files. Files matching *either* the age or pattern rule are processed.
*   **Flexible Archiving**: Moved or copied files are organized into a user-configurable archive path using templates (e.g., `{YYYY}`, `{MM}`, `{DD}`, `{FILENAME}`, `{EXT}`, `{ORIGINAL_FOLDER_NAME}`). The default structure remains `_Cleanup/YYYY-MM-DD` within the monitored folder.
*   **Safe Operations with Dry Run**: A "Dry Run" mode allows users to preview the actions AutoTidy would take based on current rules, without actually modifying any files.
*   **Background Operation**: Runs quietly in the system tray, performing checks at a **Configurable Scan Interval**.
*   **User Control**: Start and stop the monitoring service via the UI or tray menu.
*   **Status & Logging**: View the current status (running/stopped) and a log of recent activities and errors in the configuration window.
*   **Action History & Undo**: Keeps a history of file operations, enabling users to undo recent Move or Copy actions.
*   **Autostart Option**: Configure AutoTidy to start automatically on system login.

---
## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Configure**: Launch AutoTidy. The application icon appears in the system tray.
    * Left-click the tray icon to open the **Configuration Window**.
    * Use the "Add Folder" button to select directories you want AutoTidy to monitor.
2.  **Set Rules**: For each added folder:
    * Specify the **minimum file age** (in days). Files older than this will be targeted.
    * Define a **filename pattern** using wildcards (e.g., `*.jpg`, `temp_*.*`) or switch to Regular Expressions for more complex matching.
    * Select the **Action** to be performed (Move, Copy, Delete to Trash, or Permanent Delete).
    * *Note: A file will be processed if it meets the age OR the pattern criteria, according to the selected action.*
3.  **Monitor**: Click "Start Monitoring" in the Configuration Window or via the tray menu.
    * AutoTidy's worker process begins running in the background.
    * It periodically scans the configured folders based on the user-defined **Scan Interval**.
4.  **Organize**: When the worker scans a monitored folder:
    * It checks each file against the rules defined for that folder.
    * If a file matches (is older than the set age OR its name matches the pattern), AutoTidy performs the configured **Action** (Move, Copy, or Delete).
    * For Move or Copy actions, the file is placed into an archive structure. The default is a subfolder named `_Cleanup` within the monitored folder, further organized by date (e.g., `_Cleanup/YYYY-MM-DD/filename.ext`). This structure can be customized using the **Archive Path Template**.
    * If the necessary archive subdirectories don't exist, AutoTidy creates them.
5.  **Feedback**:
    * The Configuration Window displays logs of actions (files processed, errors).
    * The status (Running/Stopped) is also visible.
    * Critical errors may be shown as message boxes.

## üîß Configuration

Settings are managed via two main interfaces:

**1. Main Configuration Window (for folders and rules):**
* **Monitored Folders List**: Displays all folders being watched. Select a folder here to edit its rules.
* **Add Folder Button**: Opens a dialog to choose a new folder to monitor.
* **Remove Selected Button**: Removes the currently selected folder from the monitoring list.
* **Min Age (days)**: Numeric input for the age rule.
* **Filename Pattern**: Text input for the pattern rule. Supports standard wildcards (e.g., `*.log`, `image-?.png`) and can be switched to use Regular Expressions for advanced users (e.g., via a toggle/checkbox).
* **Action**: Dropdown or selection control to choose the action for files matching the rule: Move, Copy, Delete to Trash, or Delete Permanently.
* Configuration for folders and rules is saved automatically to a `config.json` file in your user's application data directory (e.g., `%APPDATA%/AutoTidy` on Windows, `~/.config/AutoTidy` on Linux).

**2. Settings Dialog (for application-wide settings):**
* Accessed via the "Settings" button in the Main Configuration Window.
* **Start AutoTidy automatically on system login**: Checkbox to enable/disable autostart.
* **Archive Path Template**: Text input allowing users to define the folder structure for Moved or Copied files using placeholders (e.g., `_Archive/{YYYY}-{MM}/{ORIGINAL_FOLDER_NAME}`). Defaults to `_Cleanup/{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}`.
* **Scan Interval (minutes)**: Numeric input to set how frequently AutoTidy checks monitored folders.
* **Dry Run Mode**: Checkbox to enable/disable "Dry Run" mode, which simulates actions without making changes.
    * On Windows, this modifies the Registry.
    * On Linux, this creates/removes a `.desktop` file in `~/.config/autostart/`.
* Displays the application **Version**.
* Settings are saved to the same `config.json` file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

* **Error Handling**: While basic error handling is in place (e.g., for permission errors, file not found, invalid Regex patterns), more granular error reporting and recovery mechanisms could be added.
* **Performance on Very Large Folders**: Scanning extremely large directories with many files might take noticeable time, though it runs in a background thread.
* **Pattern Matching**: Supports `fnmatch` (wildcards) and Regular Expressions. Users should ensure Regex patterns are syntactically correct to avoid rule processing errors.
* **Resource Usage**: Background polling consumes system resources. While the scan interval is configurable, very frequent checks on numerous or large folders can increase system load.
* **Archive Naming Collision**: If many files with the same name are processed by a Move or Copy action on the same day (or into the same target path based on template), they are renamed with an incrementing counter (e.g., `file_1.txt`, `file_2.txt`). This is basic and could be improved.
* **Symlinks/Shortcuts**: Behavior with symbolic links or shortcuts as monitored items or files within monitored folders might not be explicitly defined or tested. For MVP, it primarily targets regular files.
* **External Drive Disconnection**: If a monitored folder is on an external drive that gets disconnected, the application will log errors but might not handle reconnection gracefully without a restart of the monitoring service.

---
## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Potential)

* Advanced cron-like scheduling for specific times, days, or intervals.
* UI for viewing/managing files within the `_Cleanup` folders.
* System notifications for completed actions or critical errors.
* More robust handling of filename collisions.
* Internationalization/Localization for the UI.
