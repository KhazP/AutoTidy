## Overview

**AutoTidy** helps keep folders like **Downloads**, **Screenshots**, or your **Desktop** clean.  
You choose the folders and set simple rules. AutoTidy does the rest in the background on a schedule you control.

---

## What’s New in 1.5

- **AND / OR rule logic per folder** — match by **all** conditions (AND) or **any** (OR). Setting **age = 0** makes it a name-only rule.
- **Enable/Disable rules** without deleting them.
- **Custom destinations** for move/copy with a **Browse…** button; supports env vars and relative paths.
- **Exclusions everywhere**: per-folder **ignore patterns** (glob or regex) + a **Global Excluded Folders** list.
- **Preview Matches** — see what a rule will catch before you run it.
- **Better logs & history**: timestamps, severity filter, keyword search, export, “Skipped” entries, and **double-click to open paths**.
- **Status at a glance**: colored status dot, Dry-Run indicator, and **Next Run** time.
- **Notification levels respected** end-to-end (None / Errors / Summary / All).
- **Unique scan IDs** so each run is clearly grouped in History.
- **Windows-only startup** toggle; it’s disabled on other platforms.

---

## ✨ Core Features

- **Watch multiple folders**.
- **Rule-based actions**: Move, Copy, Delete to Trash, or Permanently Delete.
- **Flexible matching**:
  - **Age (days)** and/or **Filename pattern** (wildcards or regex).
  - Choose **AND** or **OR** logic per folder.
- **Custom archive routing**:
  - Template-based archive paths (e.g., `_Cleanup/{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}`).
  - Or send to **your own destination folder**.
- **Exclusions**:
  - **Per-folder** ignore patterns (glob/regex).
  - **Global excluded folders** that apply to all rules.
- **Dry Run mode** to simulate changes safely.
- **Tray app** with configurable **scan interval**.
- **Logs & History** with filters, search, export, and **Undo** for Move/Copy.
- **Desktop notifications** that follow your chosen **notification level**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Add folders** to monitor.
2. **Create a rule** per folder:
   - Set **Age (days)** and a **Filename pattern** (e.g., `*.jpg`, `temp_*` or regex).
   - Pick **AND** (all must match) or **OR** (any can match).
   - Choose the **Action**: Move, Copy, Delete to Trash, or Permanently Delete.
   - (Optional) Set a **custom destination** for Move/Copy with **Browse…**.
   - (Optional) Add **exclusion patterns** to skip files you never want touched.
3. **Preview Matches** (optional) to see sample results.
4. **Start Monitoring**. AutoTidy scans on your schedule and applies the rules.

> **Note on logic:**  
> - **AND** = file must match **age** *and* **name pattern** (unless age is 0).  
> - **OR** = file is processed if it matches **age** *or* **name pattern**.

## 📦 Installation

### Windows (recommended)
- Download the **Setup** EXE from Releases (or build it yourself).
- The installer supports **Per-user** (no admin) or **All users** (admin) installation.
- Auto-created Start Menu shortcut; optional Desktop shortcut.

### Linux / macOS
- Run from source (see below) or package with PyInstaller.  
- The **startup on login** toggle is **Windows-only** in v1.5.

---

## 🛠️ Run from Source

**Prereqs**
- Python **3.8+**
- Install deps:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt


**Run**

```bash
python main.py
```

**Build (example)**

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm --clean --name AutoTidy --icon autotidyicon.ico --add-data "autotidyicon.ico;." main.py
```

(Adjust for your layout; see your `dist/` output. The Windows installer is built with Inno Setup.)

---

## 🔧 Configuration

* Rules and settings are saved to a user config (e.g., `%APPDATA%/AutoTidy/config.json` on Windows, `~/.config/AutoTidy/config.json` on Linux).
* **Notification Level**: None / Errors Only / Summary / All.
* **Scan Interval**: minutes between scans.
* **Archive Template**: `_Cleanup/{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}` by default; supports `{YYYY}`, `{MM}`, `{DD}`, `{FILENAME}`, `{EXT}`, `{ORIGINAL_FOLDER_NAME}` and more.
* **Global Excluded Folders**: list that always gets ignored.

### Exclusion Patterns (per folder)

* **Glob examples**

  * `*.tmp` — ignore temp files
  * `cache/` — ignore a `cache` directory
  * `~$*.docx` — ignore Office autosave files
* **Regex examples** (when regex is enabled)

  * `^backup_\d{4}` — `backup_2024*` etc.
  * `\.(log|bak)$` — endings like `.log` or `.bak`

> Exclusions are checked first. If a file matches an exclusion, it’s **skipped**, even if it matches your rule.

---

## 🗂️ Logs, History & Undo

* **Logs**: timestamps, severity filter (Info/Warning/Error), keyword search, **Clear/Copy/Save**.
* **History**:

  * Each scan has a **unique ID**.
  * Filter and search; see **Skipped** entries (e.g., due to exclusions).
  * **Double-click** a row to open the file path (or copy it if missing).
  * **Undo** Move/Copy actions from History/Undo dialog.

---

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Python** (3.8+)
* **PyQt6** for the interface
* **Threaded worker** for background scans
* Uses standard libs: `os`, `pathlib`, `shutil`, `datetime`, `json`, `threading`, `queue`, `fnmatch`, and platform helpers.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

* Very large folders can take time to scan (runs in a background thread).
* Regex must be valid; invalid patterns are reported and ignored.
* Frequent scans across many large folders can increase resource use.
* Filename collisions are handled with simple counters (e.g., `_1`, `_2`).

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap / Future Ideas

* Specific-time scheduling options (beyond interval).
* Smarter collision handling / conflict resolution.
* Optional, more detailed per-rule analytics.
