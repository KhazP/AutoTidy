## Overview

**AutoTidy** is a desktop utility designed for Windows and Linux users who want to automate the organization of frequently cluttered folders such as Downloads, Screenshots, or the Desktop. It helps maintain a clean digital workspace by systematically moving files based on user-defined rules.

This tool tackles the inefficiency of manual sorting and periodic cleanups, allowing users to set their organization preferences once and let AutoTidy handle the rest in the background.

---
## ‚ú® Core Functionality

* **Folder Monitoring**: Users can select one or more local folders for AutoTidy to watch.
* **Rule-Based Organization**: Define rules for each folder based on:
    * **File Age**: Specify a minimum age (in days) for a file to be considered.
    * **Filename Pattern**: Use wildcard patterns (e.g., `*.tmp`, `screenshot*.png`) to identify files.
* **Automated File Moving**: Files matching *either* the age or pattern rule are automatically moved.
* **Structured Archiving**: Moved files are organized into a dated subfolder structure (`_Cleanup/YYYY-MM-DD`) within the monitored folder, making it easy to locate them later.
* **Background Operation**: Runs quietly in the system tray, performing checks periodically.
* **User Control**: Start and stop the monitoring service via the UI or tray menu.
* **Status & Logging**: View the current status (running/stopped) and a log of recent activities and errors in the configuration window.
* **Autostart Option**: Configure AutoTidy to start automatically on system login.

---
## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Configure**: Launch AutoTidy. The application icon appears in the system tray.
    * Left-click the tray icon to open the **Configuration Window**.
    * Use the "Add Folder" button to select directories you want AutoTidy to monitor.
2.  **Set Rules**: For each added folder:
    * Specify the **minimum file age** (in days). Files older than this will be targeted.
    * Define a **filename pattern** (e.g., `*.jpg`, `temp_*.*`). Files matching this pattern will be targeted.
    * *Note: A file will be moved if it meets the age OR the pattern criteria.*
3.  **Monitor**: Click "Start Monitoring" in the Configuration Window or via the tray menu.
    * AutoTidy's worker process begins running in the background.
    * It periodically (default: hourly) scans the configured folders.
4.  **Organize**: When the worker scans a monitored folder:
    * It checks each file against the rules defined for that folder.
    * If a file matches (is older than the set age OR its name matches the pattern), AutoTidy moves it.
    * The file is moved into a subfolder named `_Cleanup` within the monitored folder, further organized by date (e.g., `_Cleanup/YYYY-MM-DD/filename.ext`).
    * If the `_Cleanup` or dated subdirectories don't exist, AutoTidy creates them.
5.  **Feedback**:
    * The Configuration Window displays logs of actions (files moved, errors).
    * The status (Running/Stopped) is also visible.
    * Critical errors may be shown as message boxes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Prerequisites:
* Python (3.8+ recommended)
* PyQt6 (`pip install PyQt6`)

To run the application:
1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Navigate to the AutoTidy directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4.  The AutoTidy icon will appear in your system tray.

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Launch AutoTidy**: Execute `main.py`.
2.  **Access Configuration**:
    * **Left-click** the AutoTidy tray icon to show/hide the Configuration Window.
    * **Right-click** the tray icon for a context menu with options:
        * Show/Hide Config
        * Start Monitoring
        * Stop Monitoring
        * Quit
3.  **Add Folders**:
    * In the Configuration Window, click "Add Folder".
    * Select a directory you wish to monitor using the dialog.
4.  **Define Rules**:
    * Select a folder from the "Monitored Folders" list.
    * Set the "Min Age (days)" (e.g., 7 for files older than a week).
    * Enter a "Filename Pattern" (e.g., `*.log`, `image-?.png`).
    * Changes to rules are saved automatically when you edit them.
5.  **Start/Stop Monitoring**:
    * Use the "Start Monitoring" / "Stop Monitoring" buttons in the Configuration Window or the tray menu.
6.  **View Logs**:
    * The "Logs" section in the Configuration Window shows recent actions and errors.
7.  **Settings**:
    * Click the "Settings" button in the Configuration Window.
    * Here you can toggle "Start AutoTidy automatically on system login".

---
## üîß Configuration

Settings are managed via two main interfaces:

**1. Main Configuration Window (for folders and rules):**
* **Monitored Folders List**: Displays all folders being watched. Select a folder here to edit its rules.
* **Add Folder Button**: Opens a dialog to choose a new folder to monitor.
* **Remove Selected Button**: Removes the currently selected folder from the monitoring list.
* **Min Age (days)**: Numeric input for the age rule.
* **Filename Pattern**: Text input for the pattern rule (supports wildcards like `*` and `?`).
* Configuration for folders and rules is saved automatically to a `config.json` file in your user's application data directory (e.g., `%APPDATA%/AutoTidy` on Windows, `~/.config/AutoTidy` on Linux).

**2. Settings Dialog (for application-wide settings):**
* Accessed via the "Settings" button in the Main Configuration Window.
* **Start AutoTidy automatically on system login**: Checkbox to enable/disable autostart.
    * On Windows, this modifies the Registry.
    * On Linux, this creates/removes a `.desktop` file in `~/.config/autostart/`.
* Displays the application **Version**.
* Settings are saved to the same `config.json` file.

## üíª Tech Stack Highlights

* **Platform**: Cross-Platform Desktop (Windows, Linux)
* **Core Language**: Python (3.8+)
* **GUI**: PyQt6
* **Key Python Modules**:
    * `os`, `sys`, `pathlib`: For file system interaction and path manipulation.
    * `shutil`: For moving files.
    * `datetime`, `time`: For handling file age and scheduling.
    * `json`: For storing configuration.
    * `threading`, `queue`: For background processing and UI communication.
    * `fnmatch`: For filename pattern matching.
    * `winreg` (Windows-specific): For managing autostart registry entries.
* **Background Processing**: A separate thread (`MonitoringWorker`) handles folder scanning and file operations to keep the UI responsive.
* **Configuration Storage**: Local JSON file (`config.json`).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

* **Error Handling**: While basic error handling is in place (e.g., for permission errors, file not found), more granular error reporting and recovery mechanisms could be added.
* **Performance on Very Large Folders**: Scanning extremely large directories with many files might take noticeable time, though it runs in a background thread.
* **Complex Patterns**: Only `fnmatch` (shell-like wildcards) is supported for patterns, not full regular expressions.
* **Resource Usage**: The background polling mechanism, while efficient, still consumes some system resources. The check interval is currently fixed.
* **Archive Naming Collision**: If many files with the same name are moved on the same day, they are renamed with an incrementing counter (e.g., `file_1.txt`, `file_2.txt`). This is basic and could be improved.
* **Symlinks/Shortcuts**: Behavior with symbolic links or shortcuts as monitored items or files within monitored folders might not be explicitly defined or tested. For MVP, it primarily targets regular files.
* **External Drive Disconnection**: If a monitored folder is on an external drive that gets disconnected, the application will log errors but might not handle reconnection gracefully without a restart of the monitoring service.

---
## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Potential)

* Support for Regular Expressions in filename patterns.
* User-configurable archive subfolder structure (e.g., by year/month, file type).
* Option to Copy files instead of Moving.
* Option to Delete files (to Recycle Bin/Trash or permanently).
* More advanced scheduling options (e.g., specific times, more frequent checks).
* "Dry Run" or simulation mode to preview actions before they are taken.
* UI for viewing/managing files within the `_Cleanup` folders.
* Notifications for completed actions or critical errors.
* More robust handling of filename collisions.
* Internationalization/Localization for the UI.
