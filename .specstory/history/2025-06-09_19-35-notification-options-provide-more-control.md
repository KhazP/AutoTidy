*   **Notification Options:** Provide more control over notifications. For example, users might want to be notified only on errors, or get a summary notification after a scan, or disable notifications entirely.

Okay, I've added the new notification level constants to `constants.py`.

Next, I'll update `config_manager.py` to include these new notification settings. This will involve:
1.  Adding a new key for `notification_level` in the default configuration.
2.  Updating the `load_config` and `save_config` methods to handle this new setting.
3.  Potentially adding a method to get/set the notification level.

Then, I'll modify `worker.py` to respect the chosen notification level when sending notifications.

Finally, I'll update `ui_settings_dialog.py` to include UI elements for selecting the desired notification level.

Let's start with `config_manager.py`.

I've updated `constants.py` and `config_manager.py` to include the new notification options.

In `constants.py`, I added:
- `NOTIFICATION_LEVEL_NONE`
- `NOTIFICATION_LEVEL_ERROR`
- `NOTIFICATION_LEVEL_SUMMARY`
- `NOTIFICATION_LEVEL_ALL`
- `DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION_LEVEL` (initialized to `NOTIFICATION_LEVEL_ALL`)

In `config_manager.py`:
- Imported the new constants.
- Added `notification_level` to the `default_config` in the `__init__` method, using `DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION_LEVEL`.
- Added `get_notification_level` method to retrieve the current notification setting.
- Added `set_notification_level` method to update the notification setting.
- Ensured that `_load_config` correctly initializes `notification_level` if it's missing from an existing configuration.

Okay, I'll proceed with implementing the notification logic in `worker.py` and then update the settings UI.

First, let's modify `worker.py`.
